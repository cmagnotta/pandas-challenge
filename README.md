pymoli challenge

In this challenge I performed several analyses of the purchasing data for a game called Pymoli Heroes. I analyzed the data based on Gender, Age and User ID number and used several different techniques.

Note: The Age Demographic Analysis is in a separate file called Age Test. I did this for organization. I worked on the top spenders and age demo analyses at the same time -- I'd run into an issue with one and then go to the other -- and this seemed like the most organzied way to do that.
