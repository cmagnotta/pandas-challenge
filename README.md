pymoli challenge

In this challenge I performed several analyses of the purchasing data for a game called Pymoli Heroes. I analyzed the data based on Gender, Age and User ID number and used several different techniques.

Note: The Age Demographic Analysis is in a separate file called Age Test. I did this for organization. I worked on the top spenders and age demo analyses at the same time -- I'd run into an issue with one and then go to the other -- and this seemed like the most organzied way to do that.

Three observations: Males spend the most money on Heroes of Pymoli, and of that, the largest block of users were young adults and teens, although children and older adults also made purchases. Also, most users only made one purchase.

Also, here is the link to my Jupyter file.
